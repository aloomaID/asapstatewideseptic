            <h3>Summit Hill, PA Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>Summit Hill was the western terminus of the United States' second operational railway, the Mauch Chunk Switchback Railway. It was the site of some of the earliest coal mines developed in North America, where the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company began mining in 1792, establishing the town initially as little more than a mining camp with stables and paddocks.</p>
